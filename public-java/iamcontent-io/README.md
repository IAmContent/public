This jar contains two main packages of interest:

* the [usb](usb.md) package 
* the [usb.topology](usb.topology.md) package

These packages provide a usable facade over the [javax.usb](http://sourceforge.net/projects/javax-usb/) API and this library is configured to use the [usb4java](http://usb4java.org/) implementation of [javax.usb](http://sourceforge.net/projects/javax-usb/).
